# ChurchFamilyWebpage

This is my first project on GitHub, as well as my first time trying out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am a beginner, and I'm making this website to practice what I learn from tutorials.

The website's theme is the Church Family Letters, which is a collection of 30 letters that have been passed down in my family since the 1800s. I've been scanning these letters to make them available online. Designing a website dedicated to them seems like it'll be a fun way to practice web design as I learn.
